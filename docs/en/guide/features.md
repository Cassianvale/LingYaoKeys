### Anti-Sticking Mode
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Based on testing results, key speeds in games don't need to be too fast, as you need to consider the game client's response. Key speeds above 200-300 per second may cause key response delay or sticking movement.  
> This feature is only for specific gaming scenarios. If you experience sticking movement or skill activation issues, please enable this feature.  
> Setting the press-release interval to 0 can reach thousands of presses per second, but that's unnecessary ðŸ«¥
