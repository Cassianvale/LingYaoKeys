## üåè Direct Download

You can download the latest version from:

- [Latest Version Download](https://github.com/Cassianvale/LingYaoKeys/releases/latest)
- [View All Versions](https://github.com/Cassianvale/LingYaoKeys/releases)

> Note: Always download the latest version from the GitHub Releases page to ensure you have the latest features and
> security updates.

## üìñ Usage Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After extensive testing and comparing with other key tools, key speeds exceeding 200-300 per second can cause input
> lag or position shifts (depending on CPU and memory performance). This is likely due to Windows' message handling
> mechanism. For gaming, extremely high key speeds are not necessary. Based on test results, I've implemented a game mode
> with optimized settings.
> DEFAULT_KEY_PRESS_INTERVAL: Fixed time between key press and release
> MIN_KEY_INTERVAL: Minimum configurable interval between keys

- _**Game Mode ON (Default)**_: Average key speed of 120+, suitable for gaming
- _**Game Mode OFF**_: Unlimited key speed with average of 320+, suitable for general use
- _**Custom Audio**_: Open `C:\Users\username\.lykeys\sound` and replace `start.mp3`/`stop.mp3` files
